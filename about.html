          <h1>Our History,</h1>
          <p>At Community4Education, we started as a grassroots movement in 2015, with a small group of community members who were concerned about the state of public education in our area. Over time, our movement has grown to include educators, parents, policymakers, and other community members who share our commitment to improving public education through community involvement.</p>
